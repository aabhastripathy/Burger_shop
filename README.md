🚀 Just finished building my latest project — BurgerBuilder Delight 🍔

Ever wished you could customize your burger online just the way you like it? 🧀🥬🍅
That’s exactly what my new web app — BurgerBuilder Delight — does!

💡 What it does:
👉 Choose your favorite burger (Veggie, Chicken, or Cheeseburger)
👉 Add extra toppings like cheese, lettuce, bacon, and more
👉 See your real-time bill 💰
👉 Confirm your order, which gets stored instantly in a backend database

🛠️ Tech Stack I Used:

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Data Handling: JSON-based storage (orders.json)

Environment Management: dotenv

Cross-Origin Communication: CORS

Hosting-ready setup: Works locally on http://localhost:5656 ⚙️

✨ The app features real-time UI updates, persistent order storage, and a smooth checkout flow — everything you’d expect from a modern food-ordering experience!

Building this project helped me sharpen my full-stack development skills — from designing clean UI interactions to implementing backend routes that handle dynamic data.

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!
